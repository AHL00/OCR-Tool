It is a image ocr tool made in Python using the Tesseract-OCR engine with the pytesseract package and has a GUI. This is my second ever python project so feel free to make any suggestions

# Release

- To install it, extract the zip that you downloaded. Put it in a folder like program files. There is a file called OCR-Tool.exe. You could make a shortcut and put it on your desktop for easy access.
